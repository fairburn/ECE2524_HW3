It seems that if mult2.py does not have write permissions then it won't run correctly if
you pass it --ignore-blank or --ignore-non-numerical. This is because it tries to create 
dummy files of those names to avoid Python's fileinput mode giving an error, as it reads 
from every string passed as a command line argument. Allowing the script to write in its 
working directory ensures its proper functioning.
